Run LifeSimulation.java for running a simulation of Conway's game of life. It takes 4 inputs from the command line.

First is an integer, which is the number of rows required in the grid
Second is also an integer, which is the number of columns required in the grid
Third is a double value, which is the density of the grid.
Basically, density of 1 would mean every cell is alive initially, density of 0 would mean none of them are alive, density of 0.25 would mean one-fourth of all cells are alive and so on.
The third value is an integer which is the number of steps the game will run.

Note: the reset buttons will reset the grid by creating a new one with the initial conditions through input.
It will NOT go back to the same configuration, it will start fresh


Recommended intial conditions: 
150 150 0.30 (5000+)
