Grid.java takes first value boolean.
enter true if you want to build own Grid
in which case, enter the number of rows followed by columns
then enter the numbers you want to enter in regular fashion.

if you enter false, still enter the number of rows and columns but 
then the elements will be generated random between 0 and 9
